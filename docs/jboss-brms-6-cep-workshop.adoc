== Complex Event Processing

Complex Event Processing allows one to reason over Events. JBoss BRMS 6 provides extensive support for CEP through the Drools Fusion project.

The key difference between reasoning over _facts_ and reasoning over _events_ is that with _events_, one can reason over time. E.g. one can reason over time-based correlations using, among other things, temportal operators. E.g. did this event happen before that event. Did this event start at the same time as that event, etc.

== Events
What defines an Event? An Event is basically a Fact with a number of additional characteristics:

Event Declaration and Semantics
 Event semantics:
* An event defines either a point-in-time or an interval
* An event is usually immutable, however, this is not enforced by BRMS.
* An event has a strong temporal relationship
* All Events are Facts,but not all Facts are Events

What technically makes a Fact and Event? In Drools, an Event is defined by marking/declaring a Fact as an Event. This can be done in different ways:

* Using the _declare_ semantics in a _.drl_ file.
* Using the Drools _@Role(Type.EVENT)_ annotation.

A key aspect that distinguishes an Event from a Fact is the notion of time. An Event:

* must have a *timestamp*
* can have a *duration*

Hence, JBoss BRMS can both model point-in-time and interval-based events. A point-in-time event is represented as an interval-based event with duration = 0. 
Both the timestamp and duration can be configured on the Event, either via the _declare_ semantics in a _.drl_ file or via a Drools annotation.





As stated earlier, an Event must have a timestamp. However, one does not need to specifically declare a timestamp field on the Event.

* When a timestamp field is explicitly specified on an Event, the engine uses the value of that field as the Event's timestamp.
* When a timestamp field is not explicitly specified, the engine implicitly sets the time of event insertion as the Event's timestamp.

The images below provide a number of examples on how Events and their properties can be declared:

== Temporal operators
As one of the characterisitics of an _event_ is that it is something that happened at a [green]#particular point in time#, a key concept within CEP are _temporal operators_

As discussed earlier, an event can both be:

* A point in time: the event has a timestamp and a 0 duration.
* An interval: the event has both a timestamp and a non-0 duration.

Therefore, temporal operators can be defined for combinations of:

* 2 point-in-time events
* A point-in-time and an interval event
* 2 interval events

Note that some combinations can only be used with a subset of the available temporal events.

Temporal reasoning is an extensive field of research, from its roots on Temporal Modal Logic to its more practical applications in business systems. There are hundreds of papers and thesis written and approaches are described for several applications. Drools takes a pragmatic and simple approach based on several sources, but specially worth noting the following papers:

* http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.534.5791&rep=rep1&type=pdf[An Interval-Based Representation of Temporal Knowledge, James F. Allen]
* http://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Allen-CACM1983.pdf[Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals, James F. Allen]

Drools implements all 13 operators defined by Allen and also their logical complement (negation).

== Sliding Windows



== Clocks
As CEP works heavily with the concept of time, the rules engine needs a reference clock. Comparing timestamps of events with temporal operators is something that could be done without a clock (did this event occur before that event), but for a lot of temporal operations and sliding windows, the engine needs to know what the current time is. E.g. what's the average stock-price over the last 60 minutes, did an event *not* occur within 30 seconds after the current event, etc.

JBoss BRMS/Drools provides 2 clocks, so called http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latest/kie-api-javadoc/org/kie/api/time/SessionClock.html[SessionClock] implementations out-of-the-box:

* Real Time Clock: uses the system clock to determine the current timestamp.
* Pseudo Clock: a clock that can be controlled by the application.
