== Complex Event Processing

Complex Event Processing allows one to reason over Events. JBoss BRMS 6 provides extensive support for CEP through the Drools Fusion project.

The key difference between reasoning over _facts_ and reasoning over _events_ is that with _events_, one can reason over time. E.g. one can reason over time-based correlations using, among other things, temportal operators. E.g. did this event happen before that event. Did this event start at the same time as that event, etc.

== Events
What makes a Fact and Event? In Drools, an Event is defined by marking/declaring a Fact as an Event. This can be done in different ways:

* Using the _declare_ semantics in a _.drl_ file.
* Using the Drools _@Role(Type.EVENT)_ annotation.

A key aspect that distinguishes an Event from a Fact is the notion of time. An Event:

* must have a *timestamp*
* can have a *duration*

Hence, JBoss BRMS can both model point-in-time and interval-based events. A point-in-time event is represented as an interval-based event with duration = 0. 
Both the timestamp and duration can be configured on the Event, either via the _declare_ semantics in a _.drl_ file or via a Drools annotation.

As stated earlier, an Event must have a timestamp. However, one does not need to specifically declare a timestamp field on the Event.

* When a timestamp field is explicitly specified on an Event, the engine uses the value of that field as the Event's timestamp.
* When a timestamp field is not explicitly specified, the engine implicitly sets the time of event insertion as the Event's timestamp.

The images below provide a number of examples on how Events and their properties can be declared:

== Temporal operators


== Sliding Windows



== Clocks
As CEP works heavily with the concept of time, the rules engine needs a reference clock. Comparing timestamps of events with temporal operators is something that could be done without a clock (did this event occur before that event), but for a lot of temporal operations and sliding windows, the engine needs to know what the current time is. E.g. what's the average stock-price over the last 60 minutes, did an event *not* occur within 30 seconds after the current event, etc.

JBoss BRMS/Drools provides 2 clocks, so called http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latest/kie-api-javadoc/org/kie/api/time/SessionClock.html[SessionClock] implementations out-of-the-box:

* Real Time Clock: uses the system clock to determine the current timestamp.
* Pseudo Clock: a clock that can be controlled by the application.
