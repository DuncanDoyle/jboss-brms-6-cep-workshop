# JBoss BRMS 6 Complex Event Processing (CEP) Workshop

This is a workshop for JBoss BRMS 6 Complex Event Processing (CEP). It provides an introduction into the core concepts, APIs, etc. The workshop comes with a series of labs that mainly focus on rule authoring, and try to address various Drools CEP constructs and concepts (e.g. sessionclock, events, temporal operators, sliding windows). They take a novice user of the CEP platform from a set of simple rules to more complex constructs through a series of lab exercises that gradually introduce new concepts and gradually increase complexity.
